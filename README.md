#BbS4bBs

The aim of this project is to create an environment for learning multiple technologies using a real complex project.
This project uses a microservices-based architecture, in a way each one of these "Building Block Services" may use a new technology tool or can be implemented with different programming languages.
The chosen use case is a modern version of a Bulletin Board System, composed of a main menu, a file area, a messages area and external plugins called "doors".
